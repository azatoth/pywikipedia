treelang_all.py : A script that runs treelang.py for each of 
                  the pages in the NL: wikipedia. Might need minor changes
                  to work in your environment
treelang.py : The core of the general interwiki robot.
wikipedia.py : The wikipedia library
yearlayout.py : An old robot used to change the layout of all nl: year pages.

treelang.py understands various command-line arguments:
    -force: do not ask permission to make changes
    -always: make changes even when a single byte is changed in the page,
             not only when one of the links has a significant change.
    -same: try to translate the page to other languages by testing whether
           a page with the same name exists on each of the other known 
           wikipedias
    -hint: used as -hint:de:Anweisung to give the robot a hint where to
           start looking for translations
    -name: similar to -same, but UPPERCASE the last name for eo:
    -untranslated: only run on untranslated pages, and interactively ask
                   for a translation hints on such pages.
    -confirm: ask for confirmation in all cases. Without this argument, 
              additions and unambiguous modifications are made without
              confirmation.
    -autonomous: run automatically, do not ask any questions. If a question
                 to an operator is needed, write the name of the page
                 to autonomous_problems.dat and terminate.

     All other arguments are words that make up the page name.

All of the programs have "nl:" as their default. It may take a little or 
a lot to make them run on other wikipedias. Be especially careful if your
wikipedia uses UTF-8, as that has not been tested at all.

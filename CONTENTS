This is a package to build robots for wikipedia. Some example robots are 
included. This is a bit nl:-centered, but if something doesn't work for your
language wikipedia, just send a bug report and we'll take a look.

=======================================================================
PLEASE DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS PACKAGE. These programs can actually
modify the live wikipedia on the net, and proper wiki-etiquette should
be followed before running it on any of the wikipedia sites.

The contents of the package are:

LICENSE                : a reference to the Python Software Foundation license
autoredir.py           : Make redirect pages for capitalized months like 
                         [[1 Januari]]; a one-time robot for the nl: Wikipedia 
backref.py             : List all pages for which nl:->xx: does not correspond 
                         to xx:->nl:. This is obsolescent now that treelang has
                         a "-backref" command line parameter.
extract_names.py       : A program to make a list of 480 pagenames based on a 
                         html file that is the result of a Special:Allpages 
                         request.
getlang.py             : Get interwiki links for years AD
parsepopular.py        : Make statistics based on 2 html dumps of most popular
                         pages.
test.py                : Misc testing, now configured to test whether you are 
                         logged in.
treelang_all.py        : A script that runs treelang.py for each of the
                         pages in your home wikipedia. 
treelang.py            : Recursive search for interwiki links that are 
                         appropriate to a page.
wikipedia.py           : The wikipedia library
yearlayout.py          : An old robot used to change the layout of all nl: year 
                         pages.
login.py               : Log in to an account on your "home" wikipedia. 
solve_disambiguation.py: Disambiguate pages from the command line. 

More precise information, and a list of the options that are available for
the various programs, are given with the programs.

You need to have at least python version 2.3 installed on your computer
to be able to run any of the code in this package. Support for older
versions of python is not planned.

Before you run any of the programs, you need to create a file named
'username.dat' in your current directory. It has two lines: The first
line is your Wikipedia nickname; this will be used to identify you
when the robot is making changes, unless you are logged in. The
second line is normally 2 characters: the code of your default home wikipedia.
If the second line is missing, your home wikipedia is assumed to be
'test'. Some of the programs accept a -lang:XX argument to change your
home wikipedia from the default.

It may take a little or a lot to make the programs run on non-nl:
wikipedias. It has been used on en:, da:, fr: and fy: so far. We're working
on making sure it will run on UTF-8 wikipedia's without converting
them to plain ASCII.....

You do not need to "install" this package to be able to make use of
it. You can actually just run it from the directory where you unpacked
it or where you have your copy of the CVS sources.

This is a package to build robots for wikipedia. Some example robots are 
included. This is a bit nl:-centered, but if something doesn't work for your
language wikipedia, just send a bug report and we'll take a look.

=======================================================================
PLEASE DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS PACKAGE. These programs can actually
modify the live wikipedia on the net, and proper wiki-etiquette should
be followed before running it on any of the wikipedia sites.

The contents of the package are:

                         to xx:->nl:. This is obsolescent now that treelang has

extract_names.py       : A program to make a list of 480 pagenames based on a

                         logged in.

                         pages.

More precise information, and a list of the options that are available for
the various programs, are given with the programs.

You need to have at least python version 2.3 installed on your computer
to be able to run any of the code in this package. Support for older
versions of python is not planned.

Before you run any of the programs, you need to create a file named
user-config.py in your current directory. It needs at least two lines: 
The first line should set your real name; this will be used to identify you
when the robot is making changes, unless you are logged in. The
second line sets the code of your home language. The file should look like:

===========
username='My name'
mylang='xx'
===========

There are other variables that can be set in the configuration file, please
check config.py for ideas.

The robot has been used on en:, da:, fr:, fy: and hu: so far. We're
ironing out bugs showing up on UTF-8 wikipedia's.

You do not need to "install" this package to be able to make use of
it. You can actually just run it from the directory where you unpacked
it or where you have your copy of the CVS sources.

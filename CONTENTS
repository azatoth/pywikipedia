This is a package to build robots for wikipedia. Some example robots are 
included. This is a bit nl:-centered, but if something doesn't work for your
language wikipedia, just send a bug report and we'll take a look.

=======================================================================
PLEASE DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS PACKAGE. These programs can actually
modify the live wikipedia on the net, and proper wiki-etiquette should
be followed before running it on any of the wikipedia sites.

The contents of the package are:

LICENSE : a reference to the Python Software Foundation license
autoredir.py : Make redirect pages for capitalized months like [[1 Januari]]
backref.py : List all pages for which nl:->xx: does not correspond to
                   xx:->nl:. This is obsolescent now that treelang has a 
                   "-backref" command line parameter.
extract_names.py : A program to make a list of 480 pagenames based on a html 
                   file that is the result of a Special:Allpages request.
getlang.py : Get interwiki links for years AD
parsepopular.py : Make statistics based on 2 html dumps of most popular
                  pages.
test.py : Misc testing, now configured to test whether you are logged in.
treelang_all.py : A script that runs treelang.py for each of 
                  the pages in the NL: wikipedia. Might need minor changes
                  to work in your environment
treelang.py : The core of the general interwiki robot.
wikipedia.py : The wikipedia library
yearlayout.py : An old robot used to change the layout of all nl: year pages.
login.py : Log in to an account on your "home" wikipedia. 
solve_disambiguation.py:
     Can be used to disambiguate pages from the command line. 


To run any of the programs, you need a file named 'username.dat' in
your current directory. It has two lines: The first line is your real
name; this will be used to identify you when the robot is making
changes. The second line is normally 2 characters: the code of your
home wikipedia. If the second line is missing, your home wikipedia is
assumed to be 'nl'. It may take a little or a lot to make the programs
run on non-nl: wikipedias. It has been used on en:, da: and fy: so far.

This is a package to build robots for wikipedia. Some example robots are 
included. 

=======================================================================
PLEASE DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS PACKAGE. These programs can actually
modify the live wikipedia on the net, and proper wiki-etiquette should
be followed before running it on any of the wikipedia sites.

                         table2wiki.py or windows-chars.py), extract_wikilinks
                         gives them in interwiki-link format (can be used for
                         interwiki.py)

                         created by interwiki.py), and if it contains an error,
                         show a stacktrace with the location of the error.

                         of Wikipedia pages connected to a certain subject.
replace.py             : Search an article or a provided collection of articles for

windows_chars.py       : change characters that are not part of Latin-1 into
                         something harmless. It is advisable to do this on
                         Latin-1 Wikipedias before switching to UTF-8.

More precise information, and a list of the options that are available for
the various programs, are given at the start of the programs' source code files.

You need to have at least python version 2.3 installed on your computer
to be able to run any of the code in this package. Support for older
versions of python is not planned.

Before you run any of the programs, you need to create a file named
user-config.py in your current directory. It needs at least two lines: 
The first line should set your real name; this will be used to identify you
when the robot is making changes, unless you are logged in. The
second line sets the code of your home language. The file should look like:

===========
username='My name'
mylang='xx'
===========

There are other variables that can be set in the configuration file, please
check config.py for ideas.

You do not need to "install" this package to be able to make use of
it. You can actually just run it from the directory where you unpacked
it or where you have your copy of the CVS sources.

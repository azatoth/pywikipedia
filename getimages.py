"""
Script to transfer many images from one wiki to another. Your
language (which can be changed with the -lang: argument) is the
language to upload to. The images should be in a file as interwiki
links (that is in the form [[en:Image:myimage.png]]); they do not
need to be all from the same Wiki. This file can be created with
extract_wikilinks.py.

Arguments:

  -lang:xx Log in to the given wikipedia language to upload to

The first other argument is taken to be the name of the file you get
the links from; other arguments are ignored.
